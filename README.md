## Description
A massive data fundamental project that predicts yellow taxi demand across Manhattan using TLC Trip Record Data (Aug 2024–Jan 2025) to support real-time dispatch, urban mobility planning, and transportation policy. The model identifies high-demand zones by time and location to optimize driver allocation and improve operational efficiency.

## Replication

- **Step1**: Create a google cloud bucket and downloaded
- **Step2**to file size `Processed.csv` is not included in this git repo.
- **Step3**: 


   - `XXX.html`: the **primary output of the project**. It contains a comprehensive summary of the analysis, including visualizations and results. Open this file in a web browser for a complete view of the project.

  - data/: Contains datasets used for analysis.
